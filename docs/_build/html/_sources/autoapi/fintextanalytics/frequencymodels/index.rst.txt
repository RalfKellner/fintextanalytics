.. py:class:: FreqAnalyzer

   .. py:method:: count_words_in_wordlist(token_list, wordlist='esgwords')

      Count the occurence of words from a word list in a list of strings. The list of strings can be generated from raw text using the
      text_preprocessor function from the utils module. However, you are free to preprocess raw text into a list of tokens as you like.
      A few word lists are given by default and initialized with the class instance. You can also use your own list of words.

      Parameters:
      -----------
      token_list: list of str
      wordlist: str or list of str
          If you want to use internal word lists the string must be either: ewords, swords, gwords or esgwords. Or, you simply provide a list
          of strings, e.g., ['expect', 'gdp', 'revenue']

      Returns:
      ---------
      pd.DataFrame
